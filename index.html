          [Students currently have no way to automatically input due dates and their categorization (e.g. class, weight). The only current way is to manually input and sort via Excel or Google Docs, which takes hours. If instructions used a common platform (devised for the purpose) and uploaded their due dates, sorting could be done automatically per students' unique schedule.]
